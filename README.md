# elliestranslationhell
i'm a college student working on a german minor, and me and my friends wanted to play minecraft in german to learn, so i started to translate mods :-)
being a non-native speaker i'm sure there's mistakes in here, so if any native speaker *does* see this and wants to correct it, go nuts!

i haven't gotten to the subtitles on most of these bc i don't really use subtitles personally lol. feel free to fix that, and i might go back and translate some later. who knows, life is a mystery.

some of these mods didn't have official translations in their current release, but i noticed they do in their repo now. excluding those, i'll submit all of these as pull requests to the main branches.
